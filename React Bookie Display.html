<!--React Book Display -- Reading Data from JSON File with Grid 
Make a page that uses React and Babel.Your page should fetch the JSON The names of the horses should be loaded into a drop-down select. 
When the user changes the horse, that horse's rank, rating, sire, trainer, and jockey should be displayed. That horse's "silks" should be displayed in an img element. (You will have to append .jpg to the data from the file.) 
There should also be an iframe with that horse's race "embedded" as the iframe's src. The React must also create div's that belong to a CSS grid. Some of those div's must span multiple rows and/or multiple columns.
